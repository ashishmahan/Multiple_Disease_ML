# Multiple Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms
Predictive Modeling of Multiple Diseases

# Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of three different diseases: Heart disease, Diabetes, and Parkinson's disease using various machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a dataset containing relevant medical data to train and evaluate these algorithms. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up the environment, running the code, and interpreting the results.

# Project Description
This project focuses on the development of machine learning models for predicting the following diseases:

Heart Disease: Predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle factors.

Diabetes: Predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on features such as glucose levels, BMI, and age.

Parkinson's Disease: Predicts the likelihood of a person having Parkinson's disease using features related to voice and movement data.

We have used a variety of machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for each of these diseases and have evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics.

# Algorithms
We have implemented various machine learning algorithms for disease prediction, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Gradient Boosting
Each algorithm has been used to build predictive models for the three diseases, and their results are compared and evaluated.
